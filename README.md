# Issue Graph for Zenhub/Github

A simple tool for outputting a dependency graph from Zenhub.

Initially a fork of [ZenhubRuby](https://github.com/tkm-kj/zenhub_ruby), but completely rewritten. Also heavily inspired by [mikado-graph](https://github.com/lronhodl/mikado-graph).

## Installation

TBD.

You will at least need ruby-graphviz and octokit.

## Usage

bin/issue_graph <repo name>

## Contributing

1. Fork it
2. Create your feature branch (`git checkout -b my-new-feature`)
3. Commit your changes (`git commit -am 'Add some feature'`)
4. Push to the branch (`git push origin my-new-feature`)
5. Create new Pull Request
